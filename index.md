# HaloBreath – Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 30 November 2025_

Thank you for using **HaloBreath** (“the App”, “we”, “us”).  
This Privacy Policy explains what data the app processes, how it is used, and which choices you have.

HaloBreath is a breathing and relaxation app. It does **not** require you to create an account and does **not** upload your breathing data to our own servers.

---

## 1. Data we process inside the app

### 1.1. Breathing techniques and rituals

The app allows you to create and edit:

- breathing techniques (names, descriptions, phases),
- breathing rituals (names, selected technique, icon, session settings),
- session configuration (time vs. cycles, duration, sound on/off),
- onboarding / tutorial status.

This information is stored **only on your device** using local storage (Capacitor Preferences).  
We do **not** receive this data and it is not synced to any cloud service.

You can delete this data at any time by:

- deleting techniques or rituals inside the app, or
- clearing the app’s storage in the Android system settings, or
- uninstalling the app.

### 1.2. Breathing session statistics

When you complete a breathing session, the app stores a simple log entry, for example:

- used technique and mode (time or cycles),
- planned duration or cycles,
- actual duration in seconds,
- number of cycles completed,
- start and end timestamps.

These statistics are used to show you:

- your total practice time,
- current streaks and best streaks,
- recent sessions and weekly summaries.

Again, this data is stored **locally on your device only** and is not sent to our own servers.

## 2. Email feedback

From the help screen you can choose to send us feedback via email.  
When you tap the feedback button, the app opens your default email app with a pre-filled recipient:

- `materialize.thoughts@gmail.com`

You can edit or delete the email before sending.  
If you decide to send it, we will receive:

- your email address and name (as configured in your email app),
- the message content and any information you include.

We use this information **only** to read your feedback and reply to you.  
If you want us to delete your emails, please contact us at the same address and we will remove them from our inbox, unless we are required by law to keep them.

## 3. Advertising and in-app purchases

HaloBreath may show ads in the free version and offer a paid subscription to remove ads and unlock premium features.

### 3.1. Advertising

Ads in the app may be served by third-party ad networks such as **Google AdMob**.  
These providers may collect certain information from your device (for example: device identifiers, approximate location, ad interactions) in order to show and measure ads, and – where allowed – personalize them.

Data collected by ad networks is processed under their own privacy policies.  
Please review the privacy policy of the relevant provider (for example, Google) for details on what they collect and how they use it.

Inside Android you can usually limit ad tracking or reset your advertising ID in the system settings.

### 3.2. In-app purchases and subscriptions

Payments and subscriptions (such as a premium subscription that removes ads) are processed by **Google Play**.  

We do not receive your full payment details. We only receive purchase information that Google Play makes available to the app (e.g. that a purchase or subscription is active) so we can unlock premium features on your device.

For information about how Google handles purchase and account data, please refer to Google’s own terms and privacy policy.

## 4. No medical advice

HaloBreath is intended for general relaxation and breathing practice only.
It is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.

Do not use the app as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.
If you have any medical condition (including anxiety disorders, cardiovascular or respiratory problems, sleep disorders, pregnancy, or any other health concerns), consult a qualified health professional before using breathing exercises.

If you feel dizzy, short of breath, unwell, or uncomfortable at any time while using the app, stop immediately and seek medical advice if necessary.

By using HaloBreath you agree that you do so at your own risk and that we cannot be held responsible for any harm resulting from improper use of the app or ignoring medical advice.

---

## 5. Children’s privacy

HaloBreath is designed for **adults (18+)** and is not directed at children.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.  
If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information via email, please contact us and we will delete it as soon as reasonably possible.

---

## 6. Data security

All breathing data and settings are stored locally on your device.  
Please protect your device with a passcode or other security features if you are concerned about others accessing your information.

Email communications are handled by your email provider; we cannot guarantee their security beyond reasonable measures in our own inbox.

---

## 7. Your choices

You can:

- **Delete local data** by clearing the app’s storage or uninstalling the app.
- **Control ads and tracking** using Android’s system privacy settings and the settings provided by Google.
- **Contact us** at any time to:
  - ask what information we hold from your emails,
  - request deletion of such information.

---

## 8. Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example if we add new features or integrate new third-party services.

When we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.  
We encourage you to review this page periodically.
